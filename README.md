# Mobile-Price-Classification

### This repository contains a project for classifying mobile phone prices based on various features using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes attributes such as battery life, camera quality, RAM, processor speed, and other mobile specifications to predict the price range of the mobile phones.

## Features:
### Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for model training.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the relationships between features.
### Model Building: Implementing machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.
### Model Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
### Price Range Prediction: Classifying mobile phones into price categories (low, medium, high).
## Technologies Used:
### Python
### Pandas
### Scikit-learn
### Matplotlib
### Seaborn
