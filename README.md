# Mobile-Price-Classification

### This repository contains a machine learning model to classify mobile phones into different price categories based on their features. The dataset used for this project is the [Mobile Price Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification) from kaggle, which includes various attributes of mobile phones such as battery power, RAM, camera specs, and more, along with the corresponding price range.

## Features:
### Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for model training.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the relationships between features.
### Model Building: Implementing machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.
### Model Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
### Price Range Prediction: Classifying mobile phones into price categories (low, medium, high).
## Technologies Used:
### Python
### Pandas
### Scikit-learn
### Matplotlib
### Seaborn
